**`Node.js`** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript  **`runtime environment`** that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

So Node.js is **`runtime environment`** that lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools for server-side scripting to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

For me I have v14.17.3 installed on my device if you want to check your version simply run this code on your terminal :

```
node -v
```

### What is **`V8 engine`** ?

V8 is the JavaScript execution engine which was initially built for *`Google Chrome`*.

It compiles JavaScript source code to native machine code.

### So what is **`runtime environment`** ?

It's run-time compilations and it means a way of executing computer code that involves *`compilation during execution`* of a program( while it's running ) rather than before execution.

## npm :

**`npm`** stands for **`Node Package Manager`**, npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming :
**`pair programming`** commonly involves two roles : 

* The Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.

* The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming ?
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
