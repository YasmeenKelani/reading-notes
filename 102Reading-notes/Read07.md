# Programming with JavaScript
* Functions: Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.See also the [Javascript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions) to get to know the details.
* Defining functions: A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
1. The name of the function.
2. A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
3. The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

## Expressions and operators 
*  Operators: JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.Assignment operators, Comparison operators, Arithmetic operators, Bitwise operators, Logical operators, String operators, Conditional (ternary) operator, Comma operator, Unary operators and Relational operators.

## Control flow
* The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. Please visit [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions).

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
* Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers: 

Operator | Description |
 ----------- | ----------- |
  +  | Addition |
 - | Subtraction |
 * | Multiplication |
 ** | 	Exponentiation (ES2016) |
 / | 	Division |
 % | Modulus (Division Remainder)  |
  ++ | Increment |
  -- |Decrement  |
