# Introduction to Git 
* A quick thought: git and GitHub are not synonymous. Git is an open-source version management technology that was invented in 2005 by Linux developers; GitHub is a firm that offers solutions that connect with git and was launched in 2008. You can use git without GitHub, but you can't use GitHub without git. There are numerous more GitHub alternatives, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and others. Gogs and gittea are examples of “host-your-own” alternatives. All of these are referred to as "remotes" in git-speak, and they're all fully optional. You don't need a remote to use git, but it will make it easier to share your code with others.
## What is Git?
* Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that saves data in a snapshot-based file system. Git produces a snapshot of the file and keeps a reference to it every time you commit a revised version of your project. Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of the file if it hasn't changed.
* Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.
