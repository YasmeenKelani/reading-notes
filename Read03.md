# Introduction to HTML
* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
## What is HTML?
* HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

## what is Wireframe?
* Wireframing is a UX design technique that allows designers to establish and arrange the information hierarchy of a website, app, or product. Based on the user research conducted by the UX design team, this approach focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to digest information on a site.

* How to make your wireframe in six steps:
1. Do your research 
2. Prepare your research for reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

## Semantics in HTML:
* In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".
* In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page." For more information please visit [Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
